Hello,

In this project, we need to download 4 packages for us to work easily and we need to have 2 API Keys.

Our packages are called react-accessible-accordion, react-select-async-paginate, @mui/icons-material, @mui/material. To download them, it downloads them by typing "npm i -package name-" into the terminal.

For API Keys, we need to get our API Keys from GeoDB and OpenWeather.

To start the application, we can start our application by typing "npm run start" in the terminal.
